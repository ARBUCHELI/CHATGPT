* ChatGPT as a Creative Writing Assistant
-----------------------------------------
Welcome to an exciting journey where we unlock the potential of artificial intelligence to fuel your creative writing! This project will guide you through using a powerful text-based 
generative AI developed by OpenAI that operates like ChatGPT. We will refer to the generative AI component as “ChatGPT” throughout this project given that they function the same.

You will use ChatGPT as a creative writing assistant. You’ll learn how to harness its capabilities to brainstorm, draft, and refine your own short stories, exploring the realms of 
imagination with an AI companion.

1.
Interacting with ChatGPT is like talking with a knowledgeable friend. The key to getting useful responses lies in how you frame your questions or prompts. Be specific about what you’re 
asking for, and don’t hesitate to guide the AI with details or context for the best results. Try asking ChatGPT a specific question related to creative writing, such as “What are some 
characteristics of a compelling protagonist?” or give it a prompt like “Describe a bustling medieval marketplace.”


Hint
Example Prompt: “Can you explain what characteristics make a protagonist compelling and memorable? Also, could you describe a bustling medieval marketplace, focusing on the sensory 
details like sounds, smells, and the atmosphere?”
